## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a SWE with Computer Engineering education.

Right now I'm more interested in web development with Ruby on Rails, concurrency, and Web3.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
https://github.com/pmop/my-cms-blog
Toy project where I experiment with newer Rails features. Originally created with Rails 6 and then upgraded to Rails 7. Now I'm getting it to work with Turbo Frames.

  * I'm also working on a MetaMask/Web3 Rails integration, stealth mode for now.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
Web3, Concurrent Ruby, and other web application development related tech.

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
Web application development related tech, mainly in the Ruby ecosystem.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
Web3

### Some projects I've worked on in the past:
- [Î¼Java-AUM](https://github.com/easy-software-ufal/muJava-AUM)
  * [Î¼Java](http://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/mujava) is a mutation system for Java programs. This repo extends Î¼Java by adding improvements from "Avoiding Useless Mutants", along with some other improvements on the CLI I did myself.
